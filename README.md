semantic-linebreaker
====================

A utility to help you apply
[semantic linebreaks](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/)
to any text.
Try it here: http://waldir.github.com/semantic-linebreaker

Currently it's a pretty much useless,
as in merely adds line-breaks after commas and periods, indiscriminately.
Better heuristics are evidently needed.
Pull requests are welcome!
