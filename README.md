semantic-linebreaker
====================

A utility to help you apply
[semantic linebreaks](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/)
to any text.

Try it here: **http://waldir.github.com/semantic-linebreaker**

Currently it's simply a dumb pattern-replacement tool,
as in merely adds line-breaks indiscriminately
after a few punctuation marks (.,:;!?)
and before some conjunctions (but, and, or...).
Better heuristics are evidently needed.
Pull requests or issue reports are welcome!
